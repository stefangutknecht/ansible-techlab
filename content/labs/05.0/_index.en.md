title: "5.0 - Ansible Roles - Basics"
weight: 50
---

During this lab we’ll learn how to write and use Ansible roles.

### Task 1

- Create a directory `roles` in your techlab folder.
- Configure your ansible environment to use the `roles` folder as an additional resource for roles.

### Task 2

Write a role `httpd` in your new `roles` folder which does the
following:

- Install `httpd`, start its service and enable it to run on boot.
- Install `firewalld`, start its service and allow traffic for the services `http` and `https`.

### Task 3

- Modify your playbook `webserver.yml` to use your new `httpd` role. It should be run on all hosts in the `web` group.
- Run your playbook and check if everything went as expected.

### Task 4

- Create a new role called `base`. It’s `main.yml` taskfile should import the taskfiles `motd.yml` and `packages.yml`
- `motd.yml` should do the following: Use the variable `motd_content` to change the `/etc/motd` content to "This is a server\\n". Remember to move the template as well as the variable to a correct location in the `roles` folder.
- `packages.yml` should install the yum packages `firewalld`, `yum-utils`, `dos2unix`, `emacs` and `vim`
- Write a playbook `prod.yml` that applies the role `base` to all servers and the role `httpd` only to the group `web`

### Task 5

- Rewrite the `httpd` role to apply the `base` role each time it is used in a playbook. Use a dependency in the `meta/main.yml` file.
- Remove the play to run `base` role on all hosts in the `prod.yml` playbook. Run the playbook and see if role `base` was applied on hosts in the `web` group as well.
